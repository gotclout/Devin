5.
  a)	Suppose the DES mangler function (or function F) mapped every 32 bit value to zero,
      regardless of the value of its input. How does the output after Round 16 of DES compare
      to the input at the start of Round 1 of DES? Show your work and provide appropriate explanations.
  b)	Consider the following message digest (hash) function: Take the input messages, divide it into 128-bit chunks.
      XOR all the chunks together to get a 128-bit result. Run a standard message digest algorithm on the result.
      Is this a good message digest function?
  c)	Perform encryption and decryption using the RSA algorithm for the following:
      p = 3, q = 11, e =7, M = 5. Please show all the steps in a systematic fashion,
      like in page 270 of the Stallings text book.
  d)	In the public-key system using RSA, you intercept the cipher text C=10 sent to a user whose public key is e=5, n=35.
      What is the plaintext M? Show the steps.
